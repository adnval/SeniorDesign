## Project Description [[doc]](docs/CS5001/Assignment2_Team_Formation_and_Project_Description/Locale_ProjectDescription.md)
Locale is a social media application designed to bring real-world interactivity to online media. By leveraging location services within Locale, users are able to "leave" media at a specific location for other local users to discover, visit, and interact with. Locale aims to promote a sense of community for its users by encouraging them to visit posted media, form new relationships with other local users, and participate in discourse.
