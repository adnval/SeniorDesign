### Project Abstract
TODO: Work in progress.

## Project Description [[doc]](docs/CS5001/Assignment02_TeamFormation_and_ProjectDescription/Locale_ProjectDescription.md)
Locale is a social media application designed to bring real-world interactivity to online media. By leveraging location services within Locale, users are able to "leave" media at a specific location for other local users to discover, visit, and interact with. Locale aims to promote a sense of community for its users by encouraging them to visit posted media, form new relationships with other local users, and participate in discourse. 

## User Stories & Design Diagrams

### User Stories [[doc]](docs/CS5001/Assignment04_UserStories_And_DesignDiagrams/Locale_UserStories.md)

1. As a user, I want to discover media left at nearby locations so that I can explore interesting content while engaging with my local environment.

2. As a user, I want to interact with posts that others have left in my area so that I can participate in local discussions and feel part of the community.

3. As a content creator, I want to post photos, videos, or messages at specific real-world locations so that people visiting those spots can experience my content in context.

4. As a content creator, I want to see how many users have discovered and interacted with my location-based posts so that I can understand my impact and reach.

5. As a user, I want to follow content creators whose location-based posts I enjoy so that I can see more of their content when I explore.
